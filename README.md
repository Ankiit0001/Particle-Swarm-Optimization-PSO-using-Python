# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) using Python
Vectorized general particle swarm optimization code using python. 

The code can work with any arbitrary fitness/cost function with arbitrary number of optimization parameters (dimensions). To increase the processing speed, the code has been completely vectorized. All possible parallel operations are implemented using matrix mathematics. Thus, nested loops are avoided. Only a single for loop going over the iterations/generations is used.
